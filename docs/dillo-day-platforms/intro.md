# Introduction to Dillo Day Technical Projects

Welcome to the technical documentation for Dillo Day's digital ecosystem. This documentation covers the various technical projects that power Northwestern University's largest student-run music festival. Our technology stack consists of three main projects that work together to create a comprehensive digital experience for festival attendees.

## Project Overview

The Dillo Day digital experience is built around three core projects:

The Dillo Day Website serves as our primary web presence, providing festival information, ticket distribution, and historical records. Built with Next.js and modern web technologies, the website offers a responsive and engaging platform for attendees to learn about the festival and manage their participation.

The Dillo Day Mobile Application enhances the festival experience through interactive features and real-time updates. Developed using React Native and Expo, the application provides attendees with personalized schedules, interactive maps, and important announcements directly on their mobile devices.

The Dillo Day CLI Tool streamlines our development and deployment processes across all our technical projects. This internal tool helps maintain consistency and efficiency in our development workflows.

## Integration and Workflow

These projects work together seamlessly to support the festival. The website handles ticket registration and distribution, which integrates with the mobile application's badge and authentication systems. Real-time updates flow from our backend services to both the website and mobile application, ensuring consistent information across all platforms.

Our development workflow emphasizes code quality, security, and maintainability. We use modern development practices including type safety with TypeScript, automated testing, and continuous integration/deployment pipelines.

## Technical Foundation

Our technology stack is built on several key principles:

First, we prioritize scalability and reliability to handle the high traffic demands during the festival period. Our architecture is designed to maintain performance even under peak loads.

Second, we emphasize security throughout our systems, protecting user data and ensuring secure communication between all components. Our authentication systems are robust and our data handling follows industry best practices.

Third, we maintain strict version control and documentation practices. This ensures our systems can be effectively maintained and updated by future development teams.

## Getting Started

If you're new to the Dillo Day technical projects, here's how to begin:

For website development, start with the website documentation section. This covers local setup, development practices, and deployment procedures for our Next.js-based platform.

For mobile application development, refer to the mobile app documentation section. This provides comprehensive guidance on working with our React Native and Expo-based application.

For CLI tool usage, check the CLI documentation section. This explains how to use and extend our development tooling.

## Development Standards

Across all our projects, we maintain consistent development standards:

We use TypeScript for type safety and better development experience. Our code follows strict linting rules and formatting guidelines to ensure consistency.

We implement comprehensive testing strategies, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end testing where appropriate.

We practice continuous integration and deployment, with automated checks and deployment pipelines for all our projects.

## Support and Resources

Each project section contains detailed documentation for setup, development, and deployment. For additional support:

The development team can be reached through our official channels. Technical issues should be reported through the respective project repositories.

Regular updates and improvements to these projects are managed through our GitHub organization. Contributors should review our contribution guidelines before submitting changes.

## Future Development

Our technical infrastructure continues to evolve with the festival's needs. We maintain a forward-looking development roadmap that includes enhanced features, improved performance, and better integration between our various systems.

We welcome contributions from the Northwestern technical community. Whether you're interested in web development, mobile applications, or developer tooling, there are opportunities to get involved and make an impact.
